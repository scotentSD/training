## Key principles
**Always put the user first.**
When you’re writing content, focus on what the user needs to know – not what we want to tell them. And always refer to the user as ‘you’. 

**Ask questions**
Don’t be afraid to question why a piece of content is required and what format suits it best. 

**Write clearly**
Always write in plain English.

**Consider context**
When writing a piece of content, consider the context around it. What are users trying to do? What do they know already? What will they see next?
