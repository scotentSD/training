We write the same way we build apps: with a person-first perspective. Whether you’re writing for an internal or external audience, it's important to write for and about other people in a way that’s compassionate, inclusive, and respectful. Being aware of the impact of your language will help make Mailchimp a better place to work and a better steward of our values in the world. In this section we'll lay out some guidelines for writing about people with compassion, and share some resources for further learning.

### As part of an audience

- Don’t capitalize “audience” unless it’s grammatically necessary.
- Don’t refer to an audience as “it.” Audiences are made up of real people, so always use “they.”
- This goes for contacts, too. Contacts are real people, never pieces of data.  
- There’s a feature in our app called “lookalike audiences,” which is a way for our customers to market to people who are similar to their existing contacts. Always use the “lookalike” qualifier when referring to this feature to avoid confusion.
